  <p>
      Hi there, I am a command-line enthusiast also a code-farmer,
      Specialized in Javascript, and currently fooling around with Java.
      Living in the ghost island, which used to be called Formosa 500 years ago,
      Dreaming someday going to San Francisco, coding there for the rest of my life.
      Anyway I love UNIX, but I love Jessica more.
