[Tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) is a very powerful terminal tool.
I was once a user of *Screen*,
but after giving *Tmux* a try. There is no going back..., at least,
after changing its key binding to *Screen* and *Vim* alike.
It is, though, powerful enough, folks just don't content with what we have now.
So here comes one of my favo plugins - *Tmux-Powerline*.

one big problem - **Special Character**

cd /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ubuntu-font-family/  # my os is Ubuntu 12.04
PATH_TO_FONTFORGE UbuntuMono-R.ttf                # no more garbled character
{% endcodeblock %}
